# form-validator
The form-validator is an online template for forms that allows users to input their data, which the form then validates
https://jsmitthimedhin.github.io/form-validator/

# Process
I used regEx for the passwords and JS functions to validate the rest of the form.
This data is then logged into the console. Usually, we would pass the data to a database,
but the database will not be built in this project. The functionality exists for future references when there is a need.
